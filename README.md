# matrix-graph-shortest-path

This project demonstrates a matrix-based graph system capable of finding the shortest path between nodes using pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra’s or Breadth-First Search (BFS). It features a command-line interface for testing and exploration of various paths through a dynamically generated graph.

## 📁 Files

- Python source code implementing the graph and pathfinding logic
- Any helper or input files used to demonstrate functionality

## 🚀 How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed, then run the main Python file in a terminal:

```bash
python CS4310_Project_Final_Code.py
```

*(Replace with the actual main file name if different.)*

## 🔍 Features

- Matrix representation of a graph
- Implementation of shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra's or BFS
- Console interface for testing different paths and graph structures
- Modular and readable code structure

## 💡 Use Cases

- Understanding graph traversal and pathfinding logic
- Academic learning and experimentation with graph algorithms
- Simple simulations of route planning or network traversal
